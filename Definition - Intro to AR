Definition 
"Augmented reality (AR) is a term for a live direct or indirect view of a physical, real world environment whose elements are augmented by virtual computer generated sensory input, such as sound or graphics. It is related to a more general concept called mediated reality, in which a view of reality is modified (possibly even diminished rather than augmented) by a computer. As a result, the technology functions by enhancing oneâ€™s current perception of reality."

Introduction of Augmented Reality
Augmented Reality (AR) is a growing area in virtual reality research. The world environment around us provides a wealth of information that is difficult to duplicate in a computer. This is evidenced by the worlds used in virtual environments. Either these worlds are very simplistic such as the environments created for immersive entertainment and games, or the system that can create a more realistic environment has a million dollar price tag such as flight simulators. An augmented reality system generates a composite view for the user. It is a combination of the real scene viewed by the user and a virtual scene generated by the computer that augments the scene with additional information. The ultimate goal is to create a system such that the user cannot tell the difference between the real world and the virtual augmentation of it. To the user of this ultimate system it would appear that he is looking at a single real scene. Figure 1 shows a view that the user might see from an augmented reality system in the medical domain. It depicts the merging and correct registration of data from a pre-operative imaging study onto the patient's head. Providing this view to a surgeon in the operating theater would enhance their performance and possibly eliminate the need for any other calibration fixtures during the procedure.
